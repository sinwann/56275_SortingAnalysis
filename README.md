# 56275_SortingAnalysis
1. Introduction
Brief explanation of each sorting algorithm.
Why we measure time in empirical analysis.
2. Methodology
Arrays used (Arr1, Arr2, Arr3, Arr4).
How time was measured (using std::chrono::high_resolution_clock in C++).
5 runs per array, average calculated.
3. Results
Table with input size vs. average time.
Graph: Input size (X) vs Execution time (Y).
4. Analysis
Compare observed growth with theoretical complexity.
Discuss any unexpected behavior (e.g., system timing noise).
